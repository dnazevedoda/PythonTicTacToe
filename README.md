#PythonTicTacToe

I started learning Python a couple of days ago and decided to start by copying another personâ€™s code (Please see here: https://gist.github.com/qianguigui1104/edb3b11b33c78e5894aad7908c773353 ) and maybe have some tweaks here and there. Overall, experiment with code while copying and learning.

I've tried inserting an int(input) option for players' names. Which was successfully implemented.


My next idea was:
to try to randomize the order in which the players start the game since in this code Player 2 always starts first, 
add a scoreboard, 
and maybe the ability to play 1 vs the machine.

However, I still lack the proper knowledge to do that.
